üåø Plant Leaf Disease Detector
A simple, frontend-only web application that allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf and simulates disease detection. It displays a random plant disease name with its description and remedies as a placeholder for actual detection logic.

This project uses HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Features
Image Upload: Upload a leaf image (JPG, PNG, GIF).

Canvas Preview: Displays the uploaded image on a responsive <canvas>.

Simulated Disease Detection: Randomly selects a disease from a predefined list.

Detailed Output: Shows the detected disease name, description, and remedies.

Responsive Design: Built using Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern UI.

Tech Stack
Frontend:

HTML5

Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

How It Works
Upload a Leaf Image:
Click the Upload Leaf Image button and choose an image.

Preview on Canvas:
The image is displayed inside a styled canvas area.

Detect Disease:
Click the Detect Disease button to simulate detection.

View Results:
A random plant disease (from a predefined dataset) is displayed with its description and remedies.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Currently, the detection is simulated using random selection. To integrate real AI/ML detection, replace the placeholder logic with API/model inference.
